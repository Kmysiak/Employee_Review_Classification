27,4.0,Great place to work,Apple is a great place to work unless you're very family or work/life balance oriented.

28,4.0,"They create better people, not employees","This company has it all figured out.  They take care of their employees, and foster a ever-growing, ever-learning environment.

30,2.0,Quite hard to meet expectations,"Working for Apple has been great so far, what I always hated about the job, was all of the unfair surveys I got, in the chat queue, there was always some instance where the system would link a case to you (a business chat which was multi advisor) and even if you replied only: ""Bye, take care"" and the chat ended there, the system would link the survey to you whether you handled it completely or not, just because you were the last one to handle it, and this really affected my personal metrics which I hardly would reach and also my view on the company, and always managers only on the customer's side even if you did great.. It really was a pain. Stress was always there and the training to be honest was terrible.. We were thrown into Nesting not knowing anything at all about the product and the worst part was that those months' metrics were already being counted and all our training team did terrible.. It's been 7 months working for them, and I am still learning, and always complaining about the survey system.","You meet really nice people, on site support is great, when you are at home is terrible","Stressful, managers always on customers' behalf, incorrect received surveys (even if you were on chat and needed to transfer over the phone, you would get a negative survey just because the call was hung up, totally unrelated to you)"

33,5.0,Second best Job I ever had,Work was fun. Not difficult at all. Frankly it was entry level work. The problem happens because ID dictates work so all you do is make a lot of design changes. There is no challenge in the work. It is just keeping up with constant changes.,Easy work.,Lot of non engineering management.
34,1.0,How they treat their residents,I enjoyed working at Apple Rehab. At the same time I feel like they are unfair to their employees and to the residents. And that management should work together better do you make sure they're stuffed well. Also feel that they should right there handbook better to clarify resident and employee relationships to state that they do not allow you to have any type a relationship with the residents even after they have left. residents this residence leav e and come back,You meet lots of different residence and enjoy getting to know,Management is not together and do not work together to accommodate employees.

38,5.0,"Great culture, fast paced!","I had a fantastic time working for apple. I learned a lot about how to give and receive feedback, and a lot about empathy/sympathy. Working on the Genius Bar taught me about time management and setting expectations among many other interpersonal skills. Management for the largest part is very supportive and willing to help you progress. Everyone gets along in teams, and is willing to help one another out. The people are the best part of Apple.","Free lunches, supportive management, fantastic benefits.",Sometimes long hours.
39,1.0,Poor management,Managers have their favorites. They will prioritize people who suck up to the management then people who are genuine hard working. I was on a temporary contract and worked very hard during the Christmas time. I was on top relating to the sales and service but when giving the permanent contract i was ignored with few other hard working people.

My performance was alright to good but I got fired nevertheless.. In 6 Months I made one mistake that I have been aware of but the management stopped talking to me until they fired me on my last day of probation.

55,5.0,Amazing team and incredible working environment.,"Working at Apple was by far one of my favorite jobs to ever work.

61,4.0,Great for college students but zero flexibility in schedule.,"I have been at Apple as a part time field sales specialist for three years. Apple puts their people first and always takes care of the customer, which makes going to work great. Being in a part time role, I have worked Friday through Sunday from open to close basically for three years. While it was what needed to be done for me to finish my college education, it has been personally very taxing on my mental health. There is no flexibility in the schedule whatsoever for part timers in this channel of Apple. I know the actual Apple stores are a little different because employees have the ability to swap a shift with someone and they have a larger staff but in this channel it's just me covering my location. If I need a day off or I am sick my store is left without coverage so the flexibility does not exist. There is no room for promotion, which is often the case at Apple retail as well. My spouse has worked as a supervisor for Applecare at home for about six years and it's the same thing with that channel as well. The benefits are above average. I think pay is a little above normal, enough to make staying worthwhile until you find the right fit if you're ready to leave, but medical/dental/vision, etc. are good. Apple offers a variety of discounts on products & services to employees, as well as ways to give back through employee matching programs. Apple has a huge inclusivity stance. Politically, I would say most people, including leadership, fall left so for the few people who fall more conservative whether it be social issues, system issues, etc. at this time they are very alienated. - more...",,

78,5.0,Demanding but very rewarding,"You'll start the day on calls that could be a stretch of 30mins-3hrs. Varying breaks and other time off during the day makes it fair. Time management and self discipline are extremely important in this job..  Going into the role of technical support I already had a great interest in technology and a desire to help others. It's this common interest in both areas that makes the job much less stressful and complex than it might otherwise be. The combination of initial training, ongoing training, and the push to perform just makes you feel like Apple wants you to be the best you possibly could be without going over the edge..  It's not a job for everyone and you need to be in the right headspace to excel. The job was fairly tricky for the first few months but was quick to get to grips with. Experiencing both late and early shifts I would say it's somewhat easy to adapt to but this is very much on an individual basis. It will or won't work for you. No review can answer how you will adjust, that's up to you to discover..  In addition to the daily work you reap the benefits of working for the best technology company on the planet. Health & dental insurance, pension plan, stock options, and discounts across a range of products..

Every coworker I had was extremely helpful and supportive of one another. I learned a lot during that job and so did they so if either one of us had a question we could ask one another. The hardest part of the job was definitely finding different solutions to each customers' problems. I worked my hardest with each different customer to find the solution because that is the reason they came into the store.

95,5.0,Working at Apple,"I loved working for Apple. By far, one of the best jobs I’ve ever had. The workers are so understanding and actually care about each employee. I was able to really create a relationship between myself and my customer, something a lot of fast-paced environments don’t allow. I’m a very person-oriented worker, so I loved that. On the other hand, due to the long hours and slow pace, I did get tired and I wasn’t able to really stay at the job due to the fact that school was my first priority and they couldn’t really understand that or allow me to cut down on my hours.

I've personally seen someone hit Genius and did not know what an IP was! If you're a salesman by all means go for it! If you're fresh out of college and need a job that ""relates"" to IT for some years on your resumé, go for it.

Surveys that are not disputed when you've given the customer the right information and it's clear they're mad with Apple and not the customer service representative or they were rating the wrong rep, but it still applies to your stats.  Trainers don't give you the correct information, so when you start taking calls, you're teaching yourself.  Customers call about things not related to their products performance, that they should be paying for, adding emails, checking calendars, how to backup devices, why calendars go to past dates, what their Apple ID is, support for vintage devices, third party apps/products recommendations, cellular service, cost of upgrading devices to later model on the tech support line instead of calling sales. Customer assuming everyone they talk to works directly for Apple, and they know how much we make, so we should kiss their butts, and allow them to be rude and demeaning no matter what.  Their products require a pc and they don't tell customers that, so when they call to erase a passcode or backup with iTunes, they think they can do those things from their device or another apple product.  Letting customers know how much it will cost for a service appointment. Customers asking us to track their products, we can’t it’s a privacy issue.

311,5.0,Overall fairly decent...,"Job is fairly easy, and there’s tons of benefits as long as you’re Apple badged and not temp. Work is easy enough, just could get a bit stressful at times. Performance is stat and numbers driven, where there are a lot of variable factors you may not have much control of. Job progression and advancement is not as quick as advertised in the beginning. Your experience here just depends on how your manager is. Can’t complain overall.",,
312,4.0,"Good company, smart people.","In the last job I held at Apple, I adored my team. Everyone on it was a self-motivated go-getter who was smart, capable and kind.

320,1.0,Ok for 1st job,"I hated this job. We were not allowed to wear wire bras, the first 3-4 weeks the group that I was hired with had no work but sit around. ""Management"" just shuffled us around the building unsure of what department to place us (a group of 15+ people). It was so strange because it was not my first job, so I was not used to being at work and LITERALLY being required to do nothing.",,
321,4.0,Just another contract job with no ability to advance and no benefits,"They pay you pretty well, but they offer an insulting amount of healthcare coverage for the price that you pay. The culture was probably the best part. I was working the night shift which had its own challenges, but you end up becoming a big family. . So the contract lasts 1 year and they train you for about 3 months. Seems pretty wasteful since these people are only going to work for another 9 months.. They do offer extensions which can add another 3 or 6 months to your contract. But after that they cut you off.. Or.... They convert you into a vendor which is all of the things that make being a contractor bad, but now your contract has no end.. So same benefits, same pay, same hours. But now they can keep you in this limbo zone for as long as you're willing to put up with it.. Which does work for some people. But vendors have a even less likely change of moving up into full time employees, than normal contractors.. The entire systems is messed up and the recruiters are like cheat codes into getting a job. Its just too bad the jobs they are in high demand are just contract jobs.",,

324,1.0,"All talk, no walk.","Apple tends to talk about how they’re super inclusive and how they value individuals, but it’s a farce. Their profits are what counts. Though they’re a literal trillion dollar company, they barely paid above minimum wage. Though they have a whole team of schedulers for every store, they refused to give anyone two consecutive days off or give anyone the same schedule from week to week. The very first month I was there, they refused to give me time off for a funeral because it was my fiancé’s grandma, so she wasn’t MY family. They fired me for needing to take time away because my grandfather has dementia, but they did it over the phone and claimed I resigned so I didn’t get severance. Most of the parents I knew who worked with me never got to have dinners with their kids and their schedules around childcare were completely disregarded. Maybe it was just the store I worked for, but I was treated like another cog in the machine and my value as an individual was next to nothing.","Good coworkers, looks good on the resume.","No work/life balance, treated poorly by management and customers alike."

Some people willing to work faster because of line down times just to keep on with target - down time due to technical problems non related with line workers .  Others are willing to work faster just to finish 15 minutes earlier without caring about the others..

A typical day for me would be dealing with one customer after another and helping them resolve their issues with the product, whether it be troubleshoot their email account, or run proper diagnostics to determine issues they may be having with their product. The hardes part of the job for me is the work life balance. On a regular day, I could possibly be in public transit for almost 3 hours, and because it is retail, it means shift work. For someone that has a family, I don’t think retail is the best place. .  Most enjoyable part of my job is seeing my colleagues I love to work with, and getting a smile out of a customer that thought their device with all their life in it was no longer functional, but I was able to get it working again.",,
637,4.0,A fast paced way to jumpstart a career,"Skills developed at Apple are valuable at many other companies. Apple is known for hiring good people so it looks good on a resume. A very people focused job, so much of what separates a ""good day"" vs. a ""bad day"" depends on your customers that day. .  Apple tries to enable you to focus on the customer experience, however at times Apple processes completely stop you from being able to help someone, and you're expected to give the bad new to the customer. One example of this is Apple's focus on shipping devices with hardware issues to an offsite facility, though as a technician you are more than able to fix the issue onsite.",,

Before I get started with my review I want to say that my ratings is based off my job being there as seasonal and not as a full time employee. If things weren’t handled poorly like they were my review would be completely different. I hope this store actually reads this so they can make better improvement in the future. I enjoyed working there and it was a very dynamic yet fun work environment however many of us seasonals don’t appreciate how they waited last minute to let us know who can stay on permanent or who can leave. Also, when we got hired they kept putting emphasis on us being seasonal and to me it felt as if they were kinda downplaying our role there. Some of the workers there are cocky but not all. The hiring process is VERY selective and if you get in don’t mess it up for yourself, but the pay is ABOVE average than most jobs. IT IS NOT A COMMISSION BASED JOB but you can get paid between $16-$18+ depending on experience. Many people came into the store and saw how fun it seemed to us and expressed them wanting to work there. We ALWAYS had a line at the door before we opened but the customers and enviroment was fun. They made us feel like we were doing too much by grilling them for answers like our livelihoods and bills weren’t at stake and I feel as if they handled the entire process poorly. They weren’t taking it serious to me and it seemed like they didn’t care because it didn’t personally affect them.

This is not the same company I started working for in 2008. The values are different and not for the better. It's about sales and numbers and it used to be about enrichment and thinking different. Don't think different here or you'll be punished by challenging ideas and not embracing the ""culture"". Also, if you don't constantly ""toot"" your own horn you will be lost in the mix. If you do toot your own horn your co-workers will complain about you. The backstabbing will also ensue on you for being forward about your accomplishments. Don't share your ideas with others, they will steal them and use them to help themselves advance. You can't win. You'll be passed up for promotions but still be required to help train the person who DID get the job. You'll be good enough to do skill sets from the jobs above yours but when the time comes for advancement, suddenly all your shortcomings will be apparent.

They only targeted specific groups who they figured were smart and who could afford their product. They intentionally excluded and ignored other groups in their branding. The other thing that got me is that they wanted us to sit in mandatory meetings to hear them brag about how many billions the company made for the quarter but was only paying retail employees 10 dollars an hour in one of the highest volumed stores.

Chez Apple règne une sorte d'ambiance hypocrite (beaucoup de sourires forcés entre collègues ou avec les clients) qui est néanmoins typique des sociétés américaines, rassurez-vous on s'y habitue vite et l'ambiance entre collègues reste détendue et très amicale..  Enfin, retenez si vous entrez chez Apple que malheureusement tous les managers ne sont pas professionnels autant qu'ils devraient l'être et que l'image de vous que les managers pourront avoir ne serait-ce que le temps d'un CDD pourra potentiellement vous fermer les portes de cette formidable société, car si vous repostulez après une expérience chez Apple ce n'est pas la personne que vous êtes mais celle que vous avez été aux yeux de vos anciens managers qui comptera sans que ces derniers cherchent à savoir comment vous avez pu grandir derrière.",,

Overall, management cares about you as a person, but they still treat you as an employee, not necessarily a person with a nuanced life needing some flexibility as things arise.

Our company is all about innovation but on a retail level, don’t expect much. Benefits are truly great for full-time employees. Apple as a company is very accommodating to life events.

Customers expect a lot for what they are paying for, will have complex problems, will be demanding of your time and the volume of product information can be overwhelming.

The benefits are good if you enjoy Apple products, with discounts on offer after an initial probationary period. Unfortunately the pay is very low for the required training and skills. Even worse is that management staff tend to be recruited from other retail outlets rather than promoted from store staff, so their attitudes are not very ""Apple"". They focus relentlessly on quantitative metrics despite publicly claiming to care primarily about customer experience, placing huge pressure on store staff to bridge the gap between the two. Staff are instructed not to train or perform admin on their own time, but insufficient time is provided in-store outside of hours where staff are expected to be working on the shop floor - again, staff are forced to bridge this gap between competing requirements. Management's attitude to staff members with mental health problems is abysmal, with store staff being ""managed out"" if they are unable to meet the same standards as healthy members of staff.",,

Working in a project management function I found lack of project management framework and insufficient tools in place to support data driven project tracking and reporting; I have only discovered fragments of conventional as well as Agile methodologies applied to projects.

1104,3.0,"High stress, meticulous, precise","Creating world class product is Apple's forte'. However recently it seems that instead of an overall quality experience the focus shift has been to beat competition to the table at the cost of ""right first time"" customer quality experience. This filters back to the support teams dealing with the problems and specifically the dissatisfied customers..  The documented support handling requirements are abundant, extremely strict and detailed. Every aspect of action and communication, down to specific words used or action performed is closely monitored, evaluated and scored. The rules are applied rigorously with not much latitude for individuality and couched in such a way that makes dismissal legally easy and at the discretion of management..  It is therefore extremely high stress, not due to disgruntled customers; Rather for the knowledge of being constantly monitored and judged as described above. All too often management's people-skills are seriously lacking and bad being quite disrespecting, demeaning and belittling (one wonders how they ever handled customers)..  So if you like high stress, being taken to task in a demeaning, belittling way when you have tried hard but failed to meet the highest expectations; where the salary does not fit the stress scale; then this is the place for you..  I must however end of on a positive. The staff benefits: product discounts, medical insurance, fitness allowance are great.",,

The only things that were difficult about working there were; you didn't really think for yourself, everything was micromanaged, outstanding performance was overshadowed by a managers comradery with an employee that potentially didn't do as well.   .  The benefits are amazing. Not only the discount on Apple products but partnerships with other companies as well.

1240,1.0,"It’s great at the beginning, but......","At the beginning it was great, awesome pay and benefits.  Recently the quality of life at Apple has gone downhill.  The benefits have been cut down over the years and you will cap out in pay if you stay too long.  There is no interest to retain any technical talent by corporate or retail and it does show with products being released with issues or finding issues later on that impact customers.  It also shows that the technician quality has gone down in the retail side with poor training and lack of focus to protect the employee experience from abusive customers, retail = company punching bag.  There are very short paths to promote to and very little ability to get promoted without the politics.  Leadership seems to be afraid to hold themselves or anyone else, any degree of accountability, unless you stand out/up for yourself, and you will be chastised by leadership.  Not a place to work if you have a family if you are full-time, work/life balance does not exist.

Cons.  - Contractors are treated like 2nd class. - Poor management, one of whom was very unfriendly and abrasive. - Management can make you feel anxious and tense all the time with all stick and no carrot mentality.. - Contractors get no benefits, you aren't allowed to attend team events and parties and required to work bad hours.. - Complete lack of training from management or don't seem to want to nurture and teach their employees.. - Company has no idea on the future, lack innovation and are all drinking the Apple cool aid!. - Even if you have constructive criticism on how the company can improve, those staff are silenced and you can only commend and use Apple products or face backlash. This culture isn't effective for a long-term strategy where continuous improvement is key..  Show Less. Advice to Management.  - Treat contractors with care and nurture them.. - Train your managers so they can actually manager their staff and not treat them so badly.. - Innovate! Apple used to be one of the greatest innovators but has really lost touch and is stagnating, shown by their profit stats and slump in iPhone. Stop copying and get back to innovation and great design!",,

You will also learn how to help customer who are extremely upset because their tech has failed and do it in a way where the customer appreciates the help they have gained. .

People are very talented and also generally very cool and collaborative also. There is no sink-or-swim culture there. People generally help each other, especially since it is a no-commission environment..  If you want to work for Apple corporate there are not as many roads to take as one would think there would be. Sometimes corporate roles have very little to do with a person's role at retail, yet retail managers place an emphasis on retail metrics in order to get the chance to apply to corporate positions. .  Some friends have gone outside of the retail world in order to get their corporate positions. Others have applied for and joined paid internships in order to see what working in a corporate location would be like. .

From the day I started working there, it was clear to me that the company is dedicated to its workers -- they clearly understand the notion that a happy workforce is a productive one. Taking calls can be extremely trying (as with any public-facing role), and the technical aspects of the job often add to that difficulty. It is no easy thing to deal with an impatient customer and a complex technical problem at the same time.

Furthermore, there was very little concern for anyone struggling; e.g. while there, I witnessed the end of some careers, wheon more than oneoccasion, the parting party was treated with about as much respect as any new comer.

The problem some may face is the fact that you're home all the time and it becomes very isolating. At first its the greatest thing in the world. After awhile you start to feel like a hostage to your home. I believe Apple tries to make it manageable for people knowing this is a common issue-*at least sometimes*. What doesn't help for AHAs is that you're micromanaged by AUX codes the entire shift. Basically if you want to step away for 1-2 mins you have to switch into a away aux.

I was accepted and worked my way to up a Senior Advisor role. They tell you from the beginning there isn't any politics involved in the hiring process or the role. I didn't see any of it while there under contract. Once I got into the Senior role involvement with meetings and the day to day, I started to notice it.. For instance, you can't move out of your role or go home based without the approval of your manager. If they don't like you for some reason, you go nowhere..  The day to day operation is good overall. As a Senior Advisor, I had no restrictions on being able to talk to people like a human being. No scripts or guide that limited me. Breaks and lunch you need to follow as close as possible to your schedule, but I controlled my time otherwise, ie scheduling follow up appointments with customers, etc..  In the end, I became a political target and was filtered out of the company. They have a written rule about not discussing sensitive topics but it only seems to apply to customers. If you don't agree with them, you'll filter yourself out. Just the simple truth. I didn't violate any rules.",,

Co-workers are typically fun, customers can come off as entitled but that is found anywhere that sells or repairs luxury items. Benefits are great. The atmosphere on the floor is controlled chaos; managers are typically hovering around to be sure everyone is doing their jobs UNLESS they are a *favorite* employee, who can pretty much just stand around with management and chat until they're desperately needed. Retail shifts are 9 hours with a 1-hour lunch break or 4 (no break) - 6 (30 min break) hours for part-time employees. You'll be selling or troubleshooting all day long, so you have to be able to hold a conversation.

1545,4.0,"Great company environment, but low financial ceiling","Apple was a great place to launch my working career. I learned a lot of valuable skills working there, both personally and professionally. The pay is higher end retail level, unless you are able to fight through the political maze that is their career advancement process and make it to management or corporate, you will more likely flatline financially within a few years. The benefits are very good though, and they offer an amazing stock program, so if you are in a place financially to save money,  you can turn this into a solid situation, but if you pay rent, bills and have student loans its a very difficult balancing act to thrive and take full advantage of everything they have to offer.  I honestly did enjoy working there and made lifelong friends thanks to their amazing company culture and hiring standards, but the thing that eventually drove me away was the lack of valuable advancement opportunities and low wages. I would highly recommend a stint at Apple if you are fresh out of college and looking for a job, but the best way to a worthy career is to follow the technical path at the genius bar, get repair certified, and then find a similar (but less stressful) job doing the same thing for double the salary somewhere else, where they actually have budget to pay you fairly,",,

Really surprised by how professional and well-thought out every aspect of the Apple store/ service is. Definitely give props to management! I learnt to take initiative and deal with irate customers while working alongside other departments of the Apple store (Genius Bar etc..). Felt kind of out of place at the beginning but then started to slowly get to know more of the team members (who are really nice!). Probably the hardest is balancing work and being a student - the job can also be overwhelming at times during busy periods and some customers can be impatient. Also, learning about the financing options was tricky at the beginning but became easier over time. The most enjoyable part was talking to customers and learning about why they were buying a certain product.

Nearly all of the at-home advancements were either for other regions that required knowledge of other languages or a skill set that you would never pick up just from experience as a Tier 1 advisor.  Due to that, combined with everyone left working already being 5+ years of tenure, competition is simply too fierce for the very few higher professions that do become available.  This creates a drag for keeping your metrics up, if no one is watching for good reasons anyway.  They are always watching for you to mess up though.

Depending on other support workers, your schedule may or may not be broken up to allow for change in your everyday.  Usually I have to ask for some variety.  The other role that you may or may not get for 2 hours a day (roughly) is being on point either at the front of the store (sales) or at the back of the store (Genius Bar), which allows you to triage the customers reason for coming into the store, get them matched with either a sales representative or a technical Specialist/Expert/Genius.  What i have learned in my years of being there is that a retail position still has its ups and downs, even after 7 years.  Great people to work with, but not so great getting advancement.  They tend to keep people in their position if they don't journal.  Those that journal tend to be moved into new positions.

They have their favorites and they are the ones that typically get the great shifts and treatment.

Only certain groups within Apple are held to the standard of “keeping the customer’s experience in mind” - so your entire shift is basically spent cleaning up everyone else’s mistakes/being yelled at and cussed  (by customers) for mistakes you didn’t make. Mistakes that can be easily avoided if the same standards were applied equally across the board. If you struggle with anxiety or PTSD, this job isn’t for you.","Salary is good, as are the employee perks and discounts","Certain groups are allowed to dump their work on others, with no recourse."

The highly competitive sales-driven environment wasn't great for me either. I was stressed out ALOT. I ended up calling off to often and they fired me because I wasn't eligible for long term leave through their benefits partner as a part-timer. Totally sucks, but was beyond my manger's control. Now I think I have tainted any opportunity for hire at the call center which is even more of a shame because I currently live walking distance from.

What I don't like about working there are the metrics. My managers have micro-managed all of my call times and times between calls and you feel very conformed to the standards of the work flow, unlike an office building where you can walk around for a few minutes and catch up with a friend.

I usually meet most of my metrics, not necessarily exceeding them, and 9 times out of 10, I end up with a schedule the doesn't work well for my personal life. .

And leaving isn't an option because no one else is going to pay the salary Apple Pays. They will grant you shares of stock and then keep 50% of them when they mature for ""tax purposes"". The AppleCare part of the company is the most underhanded, badly managed mess I have ever seen. Run, RUN far away.

1878,4.0,Great career until the end.,"I worked 14 years for Apple as a salesman in a retail store. I was one of their best selling $100 million worth of merchandise in that time. At the beginning the products sold themselves, it was fun and no pressure. Over the years it has become more of a retail environment. I was always proud to work for Apple because I thought we weren't really retail, we more like heralds of cutting edge technology. Then it became important to sell more iCloud space, Apple Music subscriptions, overpriced iPhone cases that you could find better and cheaper on Amazon. We were told we were doing a disservice to the customer not to sell them these things. We were told it wasn't about profits, it was about the experience. There was pressure to sell what customers may not need just like every other retail environment. Managers who blatantly promoted their favorites didn't help the atmosphere any. Apple is not the way it used to be, maybe that's to be expected, but becoming a robot for profit are not the ideals I admired them so much for.",Benefits,Faking a gee-wiz attitude
1879,3.0,"It has the potential to be great, if you play the game.","As a Technical Specialist, my duties were mostly limited to the Genius Bar. This is a difficult role, one that requires immense levels of empathy and compassion. During my two and a half years there, I made it clear that while I enjoyed the work I was doing, I was interested in moving to a role that would play to more of my strengths, so that I could continue being an asset to the company rather than feel like my talents were wasted..  They dangled the idea of moving to a Creative role over me like a carrot, making me jump through hoops and moving the goalposts further and further. I'd like to think it was because I was one of the top-rated Tech Specialists by customers, and that they didn't want to remove me from that particular team, but I can't say for certain. But I know others have felt similarly - that while Apple says that there's room for growth and movement, as long as you make it clear what you want to get out of your work, the reality is that you have to deal with unreasonable amounts of inter-staff politics to accomplish your goals..  Overall, Apple is very good at cultivating a culture that is generally a pleasure to work within, until you wake up one day and realize that that culture has become your entire life, and that the ""work/life balance"" they promised you isn't real, because Apple has become your life. The moment I stopped working for Apple, I felt an immense weight lift from my shoulders.",,

Apple used to be a place to enrich people's life, bring innovation to industry, making the word better place than we found it. But now, Apple is all about sell iPhone, Apple Care. Create new iPhone ownership means do not repair, trade in you old device, even it is broken, no problem, we want to you buy a new one. No money, no problem, do activation, XR free, you pay monthly. And don't forget, everyone needs Apple Care, literary everyone! When Apple lower itself to BestBuy and Walmart, it lost everything. .

Also people working the same job can have a difference in wage of up to 8k which is ridiculous.",,Terrible management
1928,2.0,"Stressful, Mentally Draining, & Poor Management","At Apple, you are your metrics. When your job is just to sit and get screamed at by customers and your managers, it makes getting out of the bed in the morning just awful. I think I hate the idea of the job more than actually do it, but the anxiety and stress coming from all directions is  sometimes overwhelming. I spent Christmas Eve in tears because a customer, then my senior advisor, and finally a manager spent hours screaming at me while my family was celebrating in another state. .  It's easy to do the job well and maintain high metrics, but its a thankless job and you're always going to be criticized before you'll be praised. At the end of the day, it's a job that you have to absolutely love in order to prevent burnout. However, with only 7 seconds between calls for iOS employees, it's pretty difficult to keep it together sometimes. .  If you're apart of a large organization within AppleCare, then be prepared to have your manager change every 4 months which leads to confusion and instability. While there are good things about the job (discounts, decent pay for college students, flexible* work schedule, etc.), I dream of the day when I can quit. .  * I say flexible as in you select your schedule for the most part, but once its assigned it is very difficult to change if something pops up last minute.",,

It's a toxic environment on the best of days, and an absolute nightmare on the worst of days. People are placed into senior leadership roles who have no qualifications to be in those roles. .  There are two sides of Apple: the engineering side, where the brightest minds in the world work. They are given the keys to the kingdom, and rightly so. Then there's the rest of Apple, those who 'support' the engineering side of the house. And these many groups scrap for budget, headcount, etc. It's a fascinating dynamic that in the end always feels like you come up short if you're not on the engineering side of the house.",Onsite cafeteria.,Backstabbing is the norm

1988,5.0,"Excellent culture, but it's still a retail store","I learned an immense amount about being an adult with a ""real"" job during my six years at Apple.  The culture was incredible, the opportunities to learn every aspect of the retail business were readily available, and the benefits are unparalleled (even for part-time workers) in the retail world.  Depending on the store leader, it was fairly easy to have a schedule that worked around your life despite the business requirements of covering 12-14 operating hours, seven days per week..  There were many opportunities to move laterally within the company, but unfortunately there wasn't much room at the top.  A typical store with 100-120 employees only had positions for 4-6 lead positions and 10-12 managers of different levels.  You really had to be willing to move where the jobs were if you wanted to advance, especially because the senior and general manager (store leader) positions were usually filled externally by people taking a pay- or responsibility-level-cut to work for Apple.  On the other hand, if you are young and unattached, Apple makes it easy to move to nearly any mid-size or larger city in the world!.  The biggest downside is that this is, at the end of the day, just a retail job.  Most stores are housed in malls and shopping centers.  Your pay, while at the top of comparable jobs, probably won't be enough to support a family and a mortgage (if that's something you want or have).

Job security is a given with such a large and thriving company but advancement is slow as the company has plateaued (July 2019). Management is good at Apple provided you are not passed pillar to post between different managers.

This job does have its challenges but, you will work in a supportive environment where your colleagues will try their best to help as long as you are open to it. There is always room for improvement for the Specialists as well as the Senior Managers. .  The only downside to working at Apple as a Specialist are the long hours. It is a retail environment so your schedule will be different every week and they will need you on the weekends. .  You must be interpersonal savvy, empathetic, passionate, and a team player.

The pay is good but once you add benefits and healthcare your losing out on a lot of good money. The reward with stock but is isn't the best and on top of that they require you to be there for atlas a year and a half.

2095,5.0,Fun workplace with emphasis on teamwork,"Working at Apple was a great experience for me, a typical day meant communicating with a lot of customers for a range of reasons; whether it's interest in a product or someone just curious about the store and wanting to learn more. .  I learned through my experience at Apple that it's best to make a customer feel comfortable first; my perspective is that this made the encounter feel less like a transaction and more of a conversation with a friend. I learned that no matter how much you think you deserve a promotion and/or acknowledgment, sometimes you will be overlooked, and that the circumstance should be viewed as an opportunity for improvement instead of something negative. .  Apple heavily focused on workplace culture which built a lot of great relationships, including management. Often management felt like older family members who you knew were looking out for your best interest..  The hardest part of the job, to me, was helping some of the newer employees understand that even though our atmosphere was light and fun, there was a still business that needed to be maintained. The family vibe encouraged within the store would often lead to more complacent and/or relaxed behaviors on the floor..  Overall, I had a very pleasurable experience at Apple and really loved how no matter the situation, you knew there was always a team member you could depend on if assistance was required. It truly was a team environment.","Great benefits and friendly, fun work environment",Limited options for professional advancement
2096,3.0,Great for the right person on the right team,"Apple has a particular way to work and expect you get the unwritten rules of work.

2113,3.0,You have to love Apple,"I really enjoyed the work - talking to customers about Apple products. . They say they have a very flat managements structure, but in truth there are managers and employees, and the managers think they are different. Very few workers ever get promoted, despite having sort of manager-apprenticeships. Almost all managers are hired from other companies, so very few have any idea what it's like being on the shop floor. They treat employees like children, with very strict time management, ""tellings off"" and employees made to feel 'naughty' for being sick or otherwise taking time off. Managers are not paid particularly well compared to other tech industries, so you end up with mediocre middle management. . No compensation for weekend or unsocial hours, all hours paid the same. Fast paced, high pressure, high level of skill and knowledge required on the shop floor, but you get paid less than a LiDL cashier. They know there's a queue of people wanting to work for Apple, so employees are dispensable. Staff turnover is very high, because once you realise how poorly valued you are, the gloss of working for Apple wears off. Lots of corporate fluff about how their greatest asset is their employees, but when you're told that by a woman who makes $75 million a year, and you get £8 an hour for making sales of £400k plus, it sounds pretty hollow. They make a big deal of providing fruit, donuts and pizzas at Christmas, but that's like £10 worth per employee, tops.",Most other employees great people. Reasonable staff discounts on Apple products.,"Poorly paid for skill and ability demanded, Weekend work virtually compulsory, Mediocre middle management."

I also had a sense that my work was providing value to Apple..  In spring of the following year year, due to managerial reorganization, I was put into a roll that had little resemblance to the Cisco Voice networking roll I was originally asked to fulfill. I still wanted to work in the Cisco voice world but was thrown into Juniper Firewall environment. I don’t have 1⁄8th the know-how on Juniper that I have on Cisco. I have 20 years working with Cisco including a degree and certifications. .  Ultimately, I’d become a break/fix, technical support engineer working in an foreign environment. I let it be known to my manager I was not happy about this. There was nothing he could do..  I'd go back to Apple but I'd want to clarify in the interview that some changes in my career path would be hard for me to accept.

Apple has a fascinating culture and work ethic and I felt as though I never worked a day in my tenure since I enjoyed it so much. Certainly, there was pressure to meet deadlines and stress to get tools to work properly (like anywhere else in my career), however, people worked together as a team to overcome obstacles and get things done in a professional manner.

2199,4.0,Great... Until It's Not,"Apple is a very well-known company, and as such, employees are faced with standards that are often impossible. The rating system for employees, technicians in particular, are arbitrary and based entirely on the whims of the customers who fill out the full surveys. Management is supportive and tries to make the job positive, but often asks too much commitment from the best and brightest employees, causing many to burn out quickly. Many people who start working at Apple are very excited--understandably so. They say ""yes"" to everything they are asked, from staying late to coming in on days off, but after some time--months for some, years for others--it all becomes overwhelming and draining. It is also difficult for many to move up in the retail store due to changing expectations and moving goals. At the end of the day, the salary is competitive for sales and retail, but the stress of the job and the weight of the expectations for technicians do not match the compensation. If technicians were paid more competitively, perhaps the turnover rate would not be so high. I love my job, but like many others, am currently seeking employment elsewhere for better pay and a more consistent schedule.","Benefits, Required Breaks, Diverse Environment, Supportive Management","High Demands, High Traffic, Very Loud Environment, Unrealistic Expectations"

2233,4.0,A frenetic but fun workplace,"A typical day starts with clocking in and quickly checking for any important updates or emails before putting yourself into the queue. Most days were a constant stream of chats, usually 2-3 at once, so it can be pretty frenetic, but you learn a lot about multi-tasking to do well here. There's definitely a lot of opportunity to learn and grow if you're looking to, though they place greater emphasis on soft skills over technical skills. Management can be hit or miss in my several years there, as I had amazing managers who listened and were open to feedback, and some who were more rigid about what they expected. Overall the culture is very much focused on getting the right solution the first time, though with layered issues this can be more complex but that's where senior advisors come in, to take ownership of issues that may take more than one contact to resolve. I think the hardest part of the job were the times that your hands were tied due to policy when it came to resolving some issues and the occasional language barrier problems from non-native English speakers, some of whom used automated translation services to try and troubleshoot issues. But I'd say the best part of the job was being able to fix someone's issue and really make their day by getting their project back on track, or their school assignment, or maybe that amazing scrapbook for a cherished family member or event.","Great benefits, competitive pay, flexible schedules","Mandatory overtime, strict requirements for survey results"

I was a UAN (Up all night, aka 3rd Shift) Chat Advisor focusing on support for iOS devices. My preferred shift was generally from ~9pm to 6am, but it drifted back and forth a few hours every few months when ""shift bids"" happened, with the best performers getting priority on their most preferred shift pick.

I have always been an Apple enthusiast and have used Apple products since they came out. I enjoyed sharing my knowledge of Apple products and software with those that came into the store as well as facilitating group workshops and personal one-on-one trainings. I had excellent feedback from everyone I helped. However as time went on I began to realize that there was a great deal of nepotism involved in promotions and moving up to positions within the store that I coveted so that I could advance. I have had several bad experiences with unprofessional managers who had their favorite people and couldn't seem to get the type of training and support that I was seeking to move up into different positions within the store rather than just selling hardware and software on the sales floor! Believe me, after 4 years it gets tedious! I believe this was partially do to age discrimination. I was much older than most of the employees at my store but still had a great rapport with them. In fact I remain in touch with several of them even though I no longer work for Apple for some time now. I was trying to move up into the position of a mobile service technician (FRS) that I had taken training for and passed (Mobile certified). However after requesting to be moved into that position nothing ever came of it. So I feel I was really let down by Apple. I was hoping for a long term relationship until retirement. The bottom line is I feel I was let down by them and was not fairly treated and am very disappointed. Apple - more...",,

They're thrown into helpdesk positions with little to no protection from the departmental politics above them.

That being said, as a newer developer on a small team, I have received a lot of help and guidance from management and more senior developers. This is double-edged sword, however, as I also have virtually nothing to do with decisions that get made, am not privy to many decisions that get made by higher ups, and it's easy to feel like a cog in the machine.","Good work environment, supportive team, discounts on products, free software","Hard to advance in career, less autonomy than at a startup"

They boast about how much they care about their employees but it is all a white lie. 3 employees resign from a particular team within 3 months because of the manager. If you think about complaining to the HR or ER team, forget about it. The HR team is shady to an extend i can't even explain. They are rude and insensitive and are worse than con artists.   . The perks that you receive in Apple will not sum up to the stress and depression yo undergo in that place.. There is zero work-life balance and the payroll analysts go home every day at 6 or sometimes 7 (remember that the shift ends at 4.30). The management boasts about the lack of micromanagement but that is a big white lie. They monitor everything you do and use that against you. Dont even think about taking sick leaves when you are on probation because they will surely use that against you. There is no training or induction for you and you are supposed to do work from the day of your joining and higher management dont seem to care even if you complain about it unless something goes wrong.

In addition, we weren't based on commission and so providing those options to customers were effortlessly done and in a genuine way.

2494,5.0,The best retail environment around.,"Great, respectable company that treats its employees better than any other retail environment. Facilitating purchases and empowering customers to get more out of their devices, scheduling repair appointments and consultations is the general bulk of the day..  Apple stores are excellent team environments. A strict hiring policy means you work with very talented people of various backgrounds. Feedback is encouraged, and the team has a very family-like feel. Your bonds will be most noticed when new products launch, and you work together as a team to handle the unending tide of customers..  Leadership is an interesting animal at Apple. Day to day, you may not talk all that much, but there are internal tools to communicate what your goals are, and to seek guidance in reaching them. The more you talk to them, the better chance you have to move up..  That said, it is still a retail environment: Retail hours on your feet, busy holiday time, lower pay than the rest of the company, an endless supply of customers and few opportunities for advancement to divisions other than retail. Starting as part-time and working toward full time may be daunting to people looking for full-time work, but if you want it, you can get it. .  At the end of the day, it's a great company to work for if you can handle a retail environment. The Fall/Winter seasons are extreme, but the company does take good care of you.","Amazing benefits for part and full time employees, excellent pay (for Retail)","It's still Retail, warts and all.

2504,3.0,Just OK,"People pride themselves working at Apple, but very few people were passionate about Apple, which shocked me. Most people who apply are looking to be a manager for progression so it is VERY competitive. Very political there, relationships can be more important than just working hard. Required to work holidays and minimum one weekend day (Saturday or Sunday). There is NO downtime. You are helping multiple customers at once. Customers are very entitled and pretty rude. You'll need a backbone and have to leave your pride at home. I miss the Steve Jobs/Ron Johnson days. They were progressive and cared about the customer experience. Tim Cook is all about profit and gone are the days of just helping people and doing the right thing, especially at the genius bar. I love helping people, training and I love Apple products/culture. Your co-workers and Apple execs will not share the same priorities/enthusiasm. If you are looking for a job that pays well with good benefits, don't care about weekends/holidays and don't mind difficult customers in a fast-paced environment, this job is for you.","Good benefits, competitive pay, management is typically good","political, bad hours, work weekends/holidays, difficult/demanding customers, stressful atmosphere"

Most every person at my store was awesome and I truly loved working with them. I loved working there until the company took a turn to place the burden of global iPhone sales on Apple Retail. They also placed a great deal of stress on the staff to offer services- a tough thing to do when you’re in complex iPhone financing transactions.,"benefits beyond compensation, smart employees, fast paced and unpredictable","hourly compensation is poor compared to rest of tech industry, retail has burden of pushing corporate’s services"
2510,4.0,fun workplace but lack of advancement,"Apple creates a fun work place, where you meet the best people and get to work closely with coworkers. Even though they promote a very positive work environment, there is a lack of advancements with multiple job roles and are just stepping stones.

Interact and ask questions especially if you  are not familiar with most of Apple's products and their functions. If you enjoy tech and like seeing how it works this is the job for you! Get to know your peers and your managers because they are your best friends in this job! Obviously the hardest part of this job is going to be dealing with irate customers and struggling with stubborn issues.  On a good day you will have pretty simple issues that can be resolved relatively quickly (which is what you are graded on and should aim for). Depending on your manager you will be managed intensely on your ability to perform. The slightest mishaps (and bad survey scores) can earn you multiple warnings that eventually lead to disciplinary action so try to be as thorough as possible with everything you do. Be ready for short breaks and constant calls back to back (unless its a holiday).

2554,4.0,The team are incredible the work is less so.,"During my time working at apple, i built literally life long connections. All that stuff they say about great teamwork and all these people you will meet and work with is actually the best bit about working there. The work is alright, basic sales stuff really but slightly glorified because apple believe that they are the best company in the world. The management team leaves much to be desired in some areas. Although some of the managers there are great, there are several that are totally biased, blind sided and in some cases even racist. Which i know is shocking in a company that seems to promote how greatly diverse the team is. The team is diverse dont get me wrong, but there are definite under the rug issues that everyone feels, and only some people are trying to change. . You get an hour's lunch break usually around 4 hours into your shift (depending on the length of the shift) and they teach you all the tech stuff that you need to know, so dont worry if you dont know everything or anything before you start, they are just looking for outgoing and great personalities to add to the team. Hardest part of the job is probably the weeks leading up to when the new phones come out and you just get constantly bombarded with questions about what it will be and what is will look like when in reality the staff only find out on the exact same day as the customers.","Amazing benefits, the team are incredible, you feel welcome","long hours, very strict in terms of time management, no clear career progression."

The only reason I was let go was because my Veterans Affairs doctor refused to fill out required paperwork I needed to keep my job. I still am friends with at least one member from my old team. If I didn’t need to take time off for medical issues twice, I would have been promoted to tier 2 within a year of woking. The hardest part of the job, as with most customer service positions, was the customers that were extremely upset. Also as someone that is already a proficient computer technician and had worked previously at a major telecom/ISP company I had a “first call resolution” mentality where I wanted to help fix all the customer’s device problems. Apple’s tech culture was more “point the customer in the right direction and let them figure it out themselves” I didn’t agree with it but I did my job as I was expected to to the best of my ability. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my team and making friends with them even though we were spread out though the USA, also working in your pajamas is nice sometimes.","Discounts, first hand knowledge of new devices/operating systems coming out, get to work from home, quick advancement opportunities","Customers are given an article to follow instead of techs fixing them problem themselves, not having campus benefits from home, metrics"

They tend to hire you into a certain department and make it incredibly difficult to move cross-department, resulting in good people leaving the company for other endeavors and then coming back once they gain more experience.

I was upset and just wanted to start over. I requested to move from Tier 2 Phones to Tier 1 Phones to both my manager and area manager. ""Oh, well we can't do that."" Yes, they could have.

However like in true fashion management kept stringing me along making me think they would work with me on a school schedule. When push came to shove they said we do not do that. The management I had at the time felt content to let someone with almost 7 years total of Apple product knowledge walk right out the door. .  AppleCare pays well and has the opportunity to move around, but just know that what you get as a schedule is what you get and depending on what you do for AppleCare you will be on that schedule for anywhere from 3-6 m.

If you reach good stats and get good surveys you'' be upskilled to T2 iOS which is an extra 10k per year or get upskilled to Mac OS with no pay rise..  One problem with Apple is you have to be with them for 5+ years to start earning some decent coin and 5 years is a long time when you sit at home in front of an iMac 38 hours every week..  Customers aren't as abusive as you'd think as most of the time when you get a call it's usually the customer's fault and they just want you to help them fix it.. You'll get the occasional privileged individual who thinks you owe them. One good thing is that if a customer starts attacking you ie; name calling, putting you down etc you can simply give them one warning & if they continue you can hang up the phone - Apple is really good for things like that. .  Pay is pretty good for sitting on your butt in the comfort of your home. .  6 weeks of intense head drumming training and a 60 question exam at the end of the training - you have to get 90% completion and if you fail it twice you will not proceed with the role so make sure to pay attention in the virtual classroom and ask the trainer if you don't understand.

Phone support handles calls back-to-back for their entire shift, which usually results in being late to lunches, breaks or ending your shift - Which results in your Manager contacting you regarding your adherence, because you're apparently supposed to control getting a new phone call 2 minutes before your shift ends..  The Chat Support side of things is even worse. There have been months at a time where Chat Support representatives have had to handle not just one customer at a time... Not just two... But three chat interactions at one time, and if you go more than a minute without replying to any one of them, it impacts your adherence..  The culture and teamwork are very lackluster, you don't get a sense that you're working for a top of the line tech provider, you're just another drone at a desk. This has been demonstrated to me first hand in an event where my Team Manager of 7 Months had a one-on-one meeting with me (to discuss performance, career goals, etc. your standard check-in) and didn't even know my name - Even if I was in the top 3 performers on her team.","Paid Training, Good Pay","Lousy Managers, Poor Environment, Intense Stress"

2945,4.0,Support,"I've for the most part enjoyed working with apple. The biggest gripes I had were when after a time and being trained to support one product you were ""promoted"" ( not an actual promotion no pay increase or choice in the matter ) to support other products with minimal training before continuing to support not only the product you were hired to support but basically every product or service apple offers. Started on ios devices like iphone ipad ipod, then without the same amount of training they put in for teaching us to support the iOS devices we were thrown into support computer systems ie their macs. Same thing after that with even shorter training to then support the Airport apple devices and apple tv. So just without the choice and no warning ahead of time having to support all these things that alot of people had little to no actual experience with themselves without the smallest incentive of a pay bump or at least the option to stay at current pay and support certain products.","good pay and Benefits, Also Decent staff","Not having full training's when supporting new products, you didn't have a choice in opting into supporting."

2954,1.0,Think differently about working for Apple,"Apple contracts out to smaller customer service companies, this way they can pay less to the customer service reps who take the brunt of the companies failures and complaints. Instead they mostly work to make a sale, even if you are just calling for a repair they will make us try to sell you something first, if we don't we get docked for it. Management will always berate you if you do not make the sale or ""attempt the sale"". They also force you to ask fact finding questions, which is just a long way of being nosy and trying to recommend something someone doesn't need.  Not only was Apple awful to work for, but their customer base was even worse. It may be due to the hefty bloated price tag they pay. Apples 'goal"" was all about sales and meeting metrics, they didn't care how you made the sale. Just that you got the sale on almost every call. Even if it meant lying and talking up features or payments, that were in all honesty just minor scams on pricing with marked up interest (Smarter customers always caught onto the difference in price, and unfortunately you have to deal with that even if there's nothing you can do about it.). If you did not meet their sales quota even in the off season, you would get fired. It truly made me loathe the brand more than I did prior to having to learn about their shady ways. Glad to not be apart of that ""culture' any longer.",Fun training,"Training has nothing to do with production work, Pay, Work atmosphere, Sales oriented even in the off season, No commission on sales, No bonuses, Money hungry company, Hours"

Hardest part was dealing with customers.

2979,2.0,With Apple more than 12 years,"I held various roles across Apple AsiaPacific and Apple Americas. Multiple times lead to a role that wasn’t official or asked to do a job with many promises that never came to be. Moved myself for opportunities and spent a lot of money on promises and and assurance..  Was happy at first, the people were great, the honeymoon wears off and it becomes an ‘if you don’t want this job, thousands of people would take your place tomorrow’..  Ultimately left wondering if I would have had a better foundation career elsewhere..  If you get a promise, get it in writing. So you’re not left waiting for a plane ticket to be bought for you, having sold all your belongings and waiting with family, for a job that was never official. Because ‘plans can change’ leaving you hanging, then  blamed for making such big changes on the multiple interviews, promises and only internal emails confirming next steps from management to say it would happen....  You may get left blackballed after 12 years loyal service with only being told ‘if considering taking it further, Apple has a huge legal team’. Soon as that happens, you may find yourself resigning because you left your current role that was now filled while you waited, on your own Annual Leave, having to find a new home, buy all everything you need and not one apology or option for a role. Just being bounce between departments that don’t want to pay for someone they don’t have a role for..  Being treated like that after 12 years... leaves a sting it takes a while to get past and see Apple as a fair and fruitful place to work. .  I may be the unfortunate - more...","Everything is great, at first.",You’ll know you are replaceable.

You always have to ask permission from your manager.   My manager at my Dept won't let me move to another department to grow my career path what im passionate off and good at. Every time I try to move up she blocks my path to move forward.  I was offered and selected for another position I had applied within Apple and she didn't gave me the permission to move..

I worked with people who I had no control over and tried to get them to do extra work by completing Training on their own online when they aren't getting paid for it. The Management at Apple varied. Some were great, others carried their millennium prejudices and treated you like an idiot because you didn't spend 80% of your time gaming. Agism is rampant. The public culture is different that the private Apple. . The hardest part of the job is training Associates who do not want to be trained because it was easier to sell based on price, they had no sense of value. .

My store was the busiest ones in the world(no exaggeration), as a result, management tried to create an atmosphere that makes you feel appreciated.. Cons: I don't know if this applies to every apple store, but the volume of people who come in for help can be overwhelming. Because of how society is, so many people's lives are built into these devices and if things go wrong they might scream, curse, or cry and honestly, some of their situations might make you cry . You'll definitely have widows, widowers etc coming in asking you to recover entire family photo albums or voicemails from deceased husbands and wives that they accidentally erased, and there will be times when you can't help them.

Throughout my time at Apple, there was a sense that to excel at Apple, one must drink the Apple Juice. Meaning that EVERYTHING, that Apple does is just great! But I couldn't help noticing similarities between Apple and the Church of Scientology. Often, I noticed acts of retaliation, people being thrown under bus, as well as people with hidden agendas..

When you bid you never know what you will end up and that makes for a lot of anxiety if you have any sort of family life.

3253,3.0,Not much tech support in a tech support role,"A typical work day starts with punching into the company provided Mac and logging into the call logging software. A few years ago this role was solely tech support, the last years and a half Apple has pushed almost ALL customer service responsibility onto its technical support advisors. They still advertise this role as tech support however at least half of the work is not tech support at all..  Example: I get quite a few calls about battery refunds, product recalls, and Beats headphones. These are not related to tech support but you will be expected by Apple to handle these calls. Once you are promoted to the senior support level you are also required to take over ALL angry customer calls escalated to you regardless of the issue. Escalations related to account recovery and activation lock are sensitive by nature and a lot times Apple advisors cannot help customers on the phone by design, this will setup the advisor for a negative survey score because the advisor simply cannot resolve the issue. Apple does not take responsibility for this and the advisor will be expected to handle the interaction and receive a positive score. .  Unless you are a consistent high performer you will work on the weekend. The schedules offered for bids are not typical Mon-Fri work schedules, most schedules do not have consecutive days on/off, more of a scattered arraignment..

They hound on you to sell accessories and assign salesperson in one area of the store to stand in for HOURS, they forbid any employee to employee interactions from time to time and managers do this all the time. They were not pretty consistent in what they dictate in terms of operating a store and when it's busy. The way I see it, it was not sustainable way of making a living if you want to do this full time. There are irate customers coming in the store to get their phone repaired and sometimes they get over booked causing customers to wait for hours. You end up having to deal with them and become verbally abused but to take it. In retail business, you always have to think the customer is right and kiss their feet. Management at this store was not really good and planned out. They rely on HS part timers to do the sales and operations of the store. It gets quite monotonous and how cliques are in the working environment is pretty strong band because they date each other, go out after work together and all that (most of them went to the same high school). After all I give this store a one star because they lacked accessibility solutions. As a deaf person I was discriminated at this job.

However, if you are coming over from a different corporate job, it is much of the same but with less pay. .  The stores are usually busy and crowded and most customers are friendly, but some stores are poorly managed. Getting a straight answer is often difficult and you won't receive help if you need it. Managers are extremely over worked and have little patience. They advise you to ""use your resources"", which is usually your peers whom may know even less than you..  They do offer benefits that some jobs do not offer, like competitive insurance, 401K, company stocks options, and retail discounts. Being retail, you usually have to work the holidays. But most stores offer free lunches on those days. .  Overall, the company tries to cultivate a community atmosphere and encourages employees to volunteer. They offer company match if you volunteer your time or money to charities..  Bottom line, if management was treated better, the employees would be treated better.

I would only consider working for Apple again if it was in a Retail Store or at a campus in a development or team capacity, and not in technical support.

I've had top metrics on my team for 9 monthes in a row and was not even considered for the position, and my metrics are better than most full-time employees. I know somebody with horrible metrics went full time though. The recruiter for apple is completely separate from your managers and others you work with.

I started in tech support in 2010 and worked as a whipping post for about 2.5yrs before I was ""promoted"" to a sales division for small and medium business. The pay was dismal for the amount of work that was required. You were set on an inbound queue with about 10 seconds between calls. When the call was answered it was a generic customer but you were instructed by your manager to convert them into a ""business customer by all means"". It was unethical and turned customers off from doing business with Apple - all the prying questions we were mad to ask. .  The AUX culture of Apple is ridiculous! By ""AUX culture"" I'm referring to the phone monitoring system that have you attached to all day. There are varying modes to be in but they want you in available at minimum 6.5hrs hours a day. So basically all you really get is your lunch break and two 15 min breaks - standard - except for the ""variance penalty"" of 5 minutes. You can stray from your 6.5hrs a day by 5 minutes and not get reprimanded or written up. So if you've used up all your time for the day and you have a sudden bowl movement that is critical. Expect to be talked to about it. .  I would not recommend working here for the lack of advancement within the company. You get locked into a role and then they ""up-train"" you to support other divisions with no raise in pay.

But...as a Specialist in a retail store just know that you will be on your feet on hard concrete all day long, no matter your age, wear shoes that support your feet, knees and lower back or you will have problems.. The work/life balance is usually not optimal. Apple pays well and has lots of nice extras, but they do expect you to be available to them whenever they need you. I see exceptions made for students but not the rest.. You’ll work with some pretty awesome people, Apple choses a diverse and interesting crew to operate its stores and I loved nearly everyone I worked with.. Most stores are pretty busy, especially if they are the only Apple store for a long way in any direction. Launch days are exciting but rather insane, I liked them but some employees dread them. Just roll with it.. I strongly recommend keeping cough drops on hand as during holidays and major events you’ll have to talk so much in a loud environment that your throat will eventually start to give out.. If you are hard of hearing the work environment can be a challenge. It’s not just a loud environment but you also wear an earpiece connected to a walkie..

A typical day at work is answering calls and trying to sell Apple products. When you get good, you won't even have to try, and you'll start winning contests without trying either.

3662,3.0,Not fair to employees,"I learned a lot working for Apple. I loved my AHA advisor job so much that I was working until the exact minute I went into labor. They had refused to give me maternity leave and only gave me 2 weeks off even though  I worked my life off for them. Staying late, taking all extra shifts, training people, coming in on my days off, and mind you I was pregnant! They gave me 14 days to return stating if I did not I would be demoted. I asked for 2 more weeks off after a week of being back so I could put my baby on a schedule, and they then fired me. I called and called trying to get my job back, I called for weeks and no one returned my phone calls and I could not get anyone on the phone. Everything was immediately terminated so anything that was not backed up on my computer was gone. I tried to get unemployment, and the lady had the nerve to tell them that I had to be denied because I did not try to get another position which was untrue! I was a single mother of 2 with a newborn and they snatched everything from me because I needed maternity leave. I ended up homeless and in a shelter from that.

3665,5.0,Apple culture should be the model for ALL businesses.,"I can say that, without a doubt, people at Apple care deeply about the world around them. Almost to a fault.. Apple employees are generally helpful, friendly, happy, socially aware, and want to contribute to the world. Working for Apple is a bit of a guilty pleasure, especially given the current wage and quality of life crisis; Apple pays well, provides top notch benefits, and sets up all of their employees for success- this is not common among employers, especially in the SF Bay Area (where tech dominates and EVERY other industry is functioning as if it were still the 1980's)..  There is a dark side to Apple, however.... There can be a lot of pressure to excel, to work, to go that extra mile... these things can, and have, burned people out pretty badly. People say that, the work sometimes never stays at work. there are certain project groups within Apple where this problem is pervasive. Beware, your work/life balance can suffer if you get on those teams..  Otherwise, Apple is an amazing place to work. If you get hired, you're lucky.","Culture, compensation, benefits",Some people become overloaded with work and burn out.

Most of the customers that you encounter are very angry, because their products either don't work or they work and they feel that they don't work (when their products are actually working fine.) What I have learned from this Job is how to think my way through problems and break them down to be solved or come to an adequate conclusion. I encountered many people from all walks of life with this job and it has taught me a lot about human beings in general regardless or race, religion, or sexual orientation, and that is everyone has similar mannerisms when a device that Is in their pocket is not working properly. I used to have to mentally prepare myself for work, for the mental and some what emotional stress that the day may bring. The hardest part of the Job was dealing with the customers, some of my coworkers were called horrible derogatory terms out their name to be little them. Its good part time job, wouldn't make it my full time again with out a plan.

You are always by yourself except for the ability to chat with friends and management.

I liked all the managers and felt a genuine sense that they not only did their best to be everything they needed to be to upper management - but in meeting OUR needs as employees and people. The demand for excellence they set was a high bar but they provided most of the tools to be successful at hitting that bar. The only reason I left was because I had other ambitions outside of the job and had to eventually make a one-or-the-other decision. Even though I was a PT employee, I felt the demand was great, especially because Apple would require temporary FT schedules during Apple's peak seasons. But that said, and to Apple's credit, I've also never worked for a company that was so generous with benefits as to provide the same FT benefits as a PT employee. Just be prepared to fully dedicate yourself to the position and constantly educate yourself on their products and services. In the end, I didn't just learn a lot about Apple - I gained important insight from the people I helped and grew a little bit in the process.",,

3760,5.0,Apple was a fun retail experience for a short time,It was fun to be able to tell people I worked at Apple. But in all honesty its a retail job with little to no career advancements. When it comes down to open positions every employee acts like a hungry piranha and everyone applies for the SAME 1 position. I was passed over for newer employees even when I had years of experience in a certain role. Moving up into management is even harder. Apple cut off their internship to harvest corporate employees from the retail stores 1 year before I graduated and that cut off that inside track to a REAL career at Apple. .  Its a good retail job for a short time. Its not sustainable for having a family with small children. Its not sustainable for having days off with your spouse. Every employee has to work 1 weekend day. So you end up with Wednesday off and Sunday off. good luck hanging with your friends Saturday when they tail gate and you have to go fix toilet dropped iPhones.,,

They offer amazing benefits and I had worked as a part time employee and let me tell you that I have still to see benefits like the ones I had at Apple working full time positions for other companies! I would have stayed but we begin getting some interesting managers after the really good ones left our store and this was one of the reasons I left. The second reason is that while part time was great I still needed a full time position and in Apple retail that was very competitive. I got offered a full time job at another company and kept my part time for a few months until it got to difficult time management wise as the other company began to require more time.

3815,3.0,AppleCare - Great for the Unmarried/No Family,"Apple pays above average for call-center work and generally requires no prior experience. However, Apple is such a large company that advancement opportunities are scarce, and unless you are doing the work of 3 jobs, you are not considered for promotions..  Apple's attendance and PTO policies are refreshing and beneficial, and there are routine bonuses and rewards for longevity and good work..  There are limited overtime opportunities—""the needs of the business"" is the common saying—which means when it is offered, it is on a ""mandatory-not-mandatory"" basis and is technically not allowed to impact annual performance/merit increases and yet it definitely factors in..  For those with families or outside commitments, the work-life balance is difficult to maintain, and the changing policies internally about how to resolve situations is becoming more and more about the bottom line and less about stellar customer service, leaving to a very sour taste in one's mouth at the end of the day..  Change is the rule, not the exception—in my first two years, I had 6 different team managers, and this is not uncommon, as one is often shifted in to different queues or skill groups based on ""the needs of the business"" and without regard for one's interests or skills. Get stuck with a bad manager and it practically ends your career, get grouped with a good one and you will shoot to the moon if they don't promote them first for being so great.",,

Entirely frustrating to be unable to see how you are progressing and use this to hone specific skills you will need in your career. Furthermore, the way they approach training and communication around performance is entirely unprofessional. From my experience I have had to seek advice from my colleagues and have constantly had to ask, ask, ask for someone to give me some simple advice on how I'm doing and how I can improve. They will do this in the particular way of, listening in on your conversations with customers, which is quite frankly awkward. Visibly talk to someone else about the interaction and then tell a manager who will then take a huge amount of time to get back to you. For the large majority of the job there was little to no feedback given to me, without asking..

The most difficult part of my job, was the sheer number of guests in our store at any given time. Management of your time, and capabilities was absolutely huge. some people were just looking around, while others were there to purchase. I was a big part of the store, as I was the first contact for guests as they entered. It was my job to probe, detail, and accurately designate specialists, who could cater to their needs.

3858,1.0,Coasting on their reputation,"Apple used to be a good company to work for, now they are mostly just ""cool"" with very little substance to back up the hype. Speaking from my experience in my department specifically, it was not a good place to work day-to-day, let alone try to build a career. They preached innovation, creativity, and ambition, but only encouraged it from certain people/certain personality types. A lot of blatant nepotism regarding promotions and career-building opportunities as well. Tons of micromanagement regarding basic functions like bathroom breaks or stepping away from the desk to provide peer coaching, etc, as it pertained to productivity metrics. When confronted point-blank about the discrepancy between annual review/raises and the abrupt cost of living increases (in a fast-growing metro area where they no doubt got tons of tax breaks for building their ""second HQ""), management was forced to admit that the cost of living here is not taken into consideration at all, the pay scale is tied to the average salary for the job title in question. So it's not as competitive as they'd like you to believe. This probably didn't impact executive & more specialized employees very heavily, but for the call-center oriented departments it became challenging to make bills and still feel a part of the quality of life & culture that Apple is so proud of. I started out super enthusiastic about being part of the company but grew disillusioned over time due to poor management at many levels & general ""replaceable cog in the machine"" attitude toward customer-facing staff.","good discount, decent health ins.",too many to list

I am certain that it is not like this in every Apple retail store and I can not speak for what the corporate culture is like but this overarching theme of disingenuousness permeates  the retail culture..  • Hardest part of the job is dealing with the leadership teams.. • They provide great benefits and stock options. • Apple does have a decent model currently setup for self development and career path options. however it is used more and more for performance coaching.. • Pay is competitive",,

The products are top notch, and the people are all very cool and fun. There is no pressure to be something you are not, and individuality is celebrated, not discouraged..  The only real bummer is once you are in  a position, its very difficult to ascend up to higher positions. Management is often hired externally, and so becoming one from within is very rare. I truly believe that Apple would do better to search solely from within, thereby allowing people to grow and not feel stagnant. .

4104,3.0,Great Benefits; Very political environment,"As a Technician, my every day job was to assist customers on mobile and mac issues at the genius bar. The environment is very stressful as you're dealing with mostly angry customers with little faith in their products. Apple corporate also is not open at all to its Genius bar employees on certain issues so you can be stuck trying to convince your customer to have faith in their product regardless of the issue. The role isn't very technical at all and does not require too much TECHNICAL skill. In fact, many people I worked with were completely blind to the way hardware and software actually worked. You don't need any formal education (degrees, certification) to be a genius as you learn most things from working day by day. The pay is significantly lower than other technical roles in the market mainly because of the fact that you do not need to know anything technical like (Networking, Unix Systems, etc.) For retail, the pay is great..  Management is very political and the culture is VERY liberal. You must think and be like them to be favored and potentially move up. Going to corporate is almost impossible since most technical corporate jobs require real world technical experience and knowledge. The genius bar just isn't enough and is more of a customer service job than anything.",,

When a new role or position opens up they will hold “interviews” but the managers will already have their favourites picked to fill the roles. . Hours and rostering is all over the place, if you want more hours or wish to swap a shift you have to talk with a fellow co-worker to if they are willing to sacrifice their hours. They have a lot of part time staff working a average of 4-5 hours for a average shift and very few full time staff on the store floor.  And for the hours you work a fortnight you get very little in terms of pay, for example a Coles Employee earns more in their weekly pay cycle per hour than a Apple Retail Employee in their Fortnightly roster per hour. Best way of describing a part time Apple Store member is a overworked casual for half the pay. . Management in Apple Retail needs to be worked on or reworked completely, when a manager is needed for support in a difficult situation/ escalation they are either in the office or hiding somewhere else. For a Technician if you find nothing wrong with a customer’s device that has no issues with hardware or software the manager will override your decision and replace that device, this leaves the technician questioning their training and their ability to do their job effectively. And in terms of  time off, managers always seem to get time away for a trip overseas or a weekend away and upon returning to work they brag about it in front of  staff. .

They are steps that you will use everywhere, in every relationship, and they just make life better. The culture of Apple is apparent in everything you do with your co-workers, and if you get negative, remember everybody has those days, and that everybody is trying to advance too. Don't let negative feelings get in the way of your progression. Management cares about everybody even if they don't always show it, they are just super busy too with all the operations they have to take care of. They are running the store, while taking care of all the areas that need help, cut them a little slack if they don't always pay 100% attention to you. The hardest part of the job is you may not have a life outside of work, because people expect Apple employees to be superheros and make everything better, you may spend more time on the clock than initially intended, but Apple does everything to make sure you are still getting the best balance you can.

Coworkers come from a variety of backgrounds and are generally very supportive of one another. The work environment is inclusive. Uniform is simple, provided, comfortable. Every day is different depending on your role and due to constantly changing services and new products you are always learning.

This presented a much more ambiguous nature of problems from guests, with the added responsibility of owning each unresolved case and providing those callers my work schedule and phone extension. This caused me to eventually overthink about work problems outside of work, and I became more miserable. This was in the later stages of APAC's business partnership with Apple and soon after the partnership was severed.

Wages of new hires with less experience are higher than what the raises give you which is extremely frustrating. When in meetings and talking about this, management always says ""we are working on it"". Essentially nothing is ever done about this..  Store meetings are epic waste of time and only good for free food and extra paid time for showing up. Management doesn't listen to employees input and simply changes their strategy every single meeting. .  Communication on new practices and strategies in store is horrible and the management likes to change store strategy every other week especially with the genius bar.  Find something that works well enough and stick to it. Never ending fight to figure out how to please both customer and employee..

Working at different locations can be eye opening of the different practices from location to location but one thing that is the same no matter what location is the friendliness and welcoming atmosphere. The management team varied where some locations management were very helpful and other locations management seems to stay in the back and didn't have a big presence on the floor.

It was $15 an hour....  15 X 25 = like $375 a week max and not enough to live off of. .   My advice to Apple -  After 6 months let any part time employee who wants to go full time....  go full time.

Apple needs to learn that their customers do need to take personal responsibility for most of their own issues as the majority of the support related calls are due to customer created issues. Scheduling is another thing. You either work in retail with those lousy hours or you bid for a 90 day shift that can turn your life upside down and cause you to eat up all of your vacation time to take time off for family events.

4769,2.0,Overrated,"After about 6 months of working for Apple, you start to realize its just another retail store at its core. Appears nice on the outside, far from it on the inside.  Heavy favouritism from management, poor scheduling & overworked staff. You think a company this rich can invest in a decent break room?  Instead- its a cold & sterile white room shared with a receiving area that has one table and a sink, hard plastic white chairs you can't even be comfortable in. Everyone walking around fake smiling and pretending to be SO happy and always clapping at just about anything a manager says just so they can get noticed..  It's not all bad beyond that. If you are a fan of Apple devices, then the interactions with customers are genuinely fun, and the days fly by. You will learn a lot of skills based of the sheer number of people you talk to every day.  If you can handle through the insane amount of traffic, (good luck at Christmas) and if you can deal with fake management, then you may enjoy it.","Full benefits, Good discounts, Days go quick","Poor management, No work life balance, Mentally Stressful"

Originally coming from AppleCare, which is the over-the-phone support line, and into a retail store position can be daunting..  Through my experience in-store & AppleCare (no not the in-store experiences)  I've witness that there is a huge divide among AppleCare and Apple Retail. What this means is there seems to be an, ""us & them"" way of thinking. Typically some advisors position information poorly to customers which leads to false expectations for in-store experiences. However, this can also be flipped the other way around. Some AppleCare Advisors can see in-store technicians as just wanting to run the customer's out of the store and on to the next customer..  For the most part, currently as a Technical Specialist, the experience in store is very different from over the phone support. . 1. You have customers eyeing you down hoping that they're the next person to be seen for their appointment.. 2. Meltdowns & difficult situations have to be handled by you, there's no Tier 2's at the Apple Store, YOU are the Tier 2. Leaders are there if you need help, but the brains of the solutions are left up to you.. 3. Employees have your back, if you have theirs. Interpersonal communication is ESSENTIAL, because most of what you learn in store are from those around you. In AppleCare, it's left up to you by reading articles and minimally interacting with coworkers through chat or FaceTime.. 4. Most of the feedback in AppleCare is left - more...","Free lunches occasionally, In-store discounts as well as EPP discounts, Stock Plans, access to free classes such as stock investments, exclusive Apple opportunities for insource growth, multiple breaks during 8hr shifts, flexibility in time.","Not enough training time for development, the ""Us & Them"" complex, advancement into new roles can be strenuously difficult."

From the cult-like behavior, to the self-posturing and five-star act everyone puts on, evangelizing Apple's dogma they drill into your heads day in and day out - on how you should act to be to be a star specialist. Apple tries make you feel like its a philosophy, working for them, that if you listen to them, then all will be well. That you'll find some purpose in your life if you live up to their expectations..  But the truth is working at Apple can be an attack on your mental health. The customers are obnoxious in so many varying degrees and the managers act like the whole system of things is just right when really the system is overloaded with demanding, self-entitled customers and a bunch of people that are suppressing themselves just to make it through Apple retail without losing their grip on reality..  Unless you're ready to deal with customer after customer who loves to play games and try to match wits with you on a daily basis regarding product knowledge or challenge you why they should buy an Apple product at all. And you're ready to help literally thousands of lazy old people reset their sbcglobal or yahoo email account password a dozen times a day over the course of several years, then don't work for Apple..  Not to mention, you will face an onslaught of volatile people in general, being crowded out from every direction by noise and a cacophony of sound from all the mixed babble of people talking in one small store at the same time. - more...","Discounts, Decent Hourly, Great Products","No Commission whatsoever!
